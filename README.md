# Plotting-Graphs
Plotting graphs, subplots, and adding labels in matlab.
In particular we are plotting `f(x) = x`, `f(x) = x^2`, `f(x) = x^3`, and `f(x) = sin(x)` in the first program.

We continue by graphing `f(x) = sin(x)`, `f(x) = cos(x)`, `f(x) = e^x`, and `f(x) = ln(x)` in the second program.
